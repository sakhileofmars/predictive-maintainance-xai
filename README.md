# Predictive Maintenance with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

Predictive maintenance is a critical aspect of industrial operations, aimed at predicting potential equipment failures before they occur. In this project, we develop a predictive maintenance solution using machine learning techniques, with a focus on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The goal is to predict equipment failures based on multivariate input data while providing interpretable explanations for the predictions.

## Project Overview

Predictive maintenance is essential for reducing downtime, optimizing maintenance schedules, and minimizing operational costs in industrial settings. This project aims to address predictive maintenance challenges by developing a robust model capable of predicting equipment failures and providing clear explanations for these predictions.

### Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and trends in the data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, clean the data, and preprocess it for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and select relevant ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance tasks.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the selected models on the data and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics.
- **Model Interpretation**: Understand model predictions and extract actionable insights using XAI techniques.
- **Experiments and Case Studies**: Conduct experiments to assess model performance and document success/failure instances.
- **Additional Data Sourcing and Cleaning**: Identify and acquire relevant additional datasets to enhance model generalization.
- **Tool Development**: Develop a lightweight tool for failure prediction and explanation, ensuring user-friendliness and scalability.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the developed tool in a suitable environment and provide user training and support.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains multivariate input data related to industrial equipment, including various sensor readings, operational parameters, and maintenance records. The target variable is the occurrence of equipment failure, which is binary (1 for failure, 0 for non-failure).

- **Dataset Source**: [Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabbiswas1/microsoft-azure-predictive-maintenance?resource=download)
